# Under the hood: ReactJS
Well, how to explain how ReactJS work? And, how to make it easier to catch from the first time and make the whole article easy to read and follow? So, obviously, we should try to  avoid a lot of inline code and referring to variables, because really, without context, that variables are useless and just add more mess, and, if we are talking about big amount of code, so, there is no way to follow code logic by mentioning just some separate variables. I’ve been trying to avoid that as much as possible but instead describing more abstract ideas, flows, and logic behind code variables and modules (in fact, sometimes it was hard to do that, so I mentioned some methods or variables explicitly). Also, at the same time, I tried not to be too abstractive, and cover all important details, even if they were on the very deep and exact level or case.

Each scheme is clickable and can be opened in a new tab, use that to zoom it and be able to read from it. Keep the article and a scheme you are reading about at that moment in separate windows (tabs), that will help to match text and code flow easier.

We are gonna talk here about both ReactJS versions, current one with Stack reconciler and the next one with Fiber (as you probably know, the next version of ReactJS will be released soon), so, you can understand better how current React works and appreciate huge achievements on React-Fiber.  We use React v15.4.2 for explaining how ‘legacy React’ works and React v16.*.*** for ‘Fiber’. Let’s start from old (I have fun to say that) stack version.
